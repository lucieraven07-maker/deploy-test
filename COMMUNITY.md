# Ghost Community

Ghost thrives because of a global community of privacy advocates, students, researchers, and ethical developers. This is your home.

## 🎓 Built by Malaysian Universities
Ghost was architected and stress-tested by a founding team spanning:
- **Asia Pacific University (APU)** – Core frontend & crypto logic  
- **Sunway University** – PWA architecture & UX flow  
- **Taylor’s University** – Security audits & session protocol  
- **UNITEN** – Founder + system design (Lucieran Raven)  

We’re proud to represent Malaysia’s next generation of privacy builders. If you’re from any of these unis — you’re family. 

> 🔬 Ghost is a living lab for **real-world privacy engineering**.

## 👨‍💻 For Developers

- **Audit our codebase** — especially Web Crypto and PWA behavior  
- **Test on low-end devices** — ensure accessibility in resource-constrained environments  
- **Improve UX** — focus on clarity, safety, and minimalism (no bloat)  
- **Help with internationalization** (i18n) or screen reader support  

> 💡 All contributions must be **non-commercial and privacy-preserving**.
