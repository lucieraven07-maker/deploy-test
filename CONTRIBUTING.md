# Contributing to Ghost

Ghost is a **mission-first startup**. While we’re open-source, we forbid commercial forks that rebrand or monetize our core tech without permission.

## ✅ Allowed Contributions

We welcome and encourage:
- **Security fixes**: Crypto flaws, MITM vulnerabilities, memory leaks, metadata exposure
- **UX improvements**: Mobile responsiveness, accessibility (WCAG), clarity, performance
- **Documentation**: Architecture diagrams, threat models, academic write-ups
- **Academic extensions**: Formal verification, protocol analysis, educational demos

## ❌ Prohibited Contributions

Do **not** submit:
- Commercial features (e.g., SaaS integrations, payment systems)
- Monetization logic (ads, analytics beyond GoatCounter, tracking)
- Rebranding of core components as “Ghost” or similar
- Changes that weaken ephemeral guarantees (e.g., localStorage caching)

## 📝 Contribution Process

1. **Fork** the repository
2. Create a new branch (e.g., `fix/voice-blob-leak`)
3. Make your changes **in VS Code** (not via GitHub web editor for code)
4. Write a clear commit message explaining the **non-commercial, privacy-preserving intent**
5. Open a **Pull Request** to `main`
6. Await review by **@Lucieran-Raven**

> 🔐 All PRs are reviewed for **technical correctness** and **alignment with Ghost’s mission**.

## 📚 For Students & Researchers

- Use Ghost as a **case study** in your coursework
- Reference the architecture in **academic papers** (cite: *Ghost, LucieRaven, 2025*)
- Build **educational forks** — but **rename your project** (e.g., “EphemeralChat”)
- Focus on **verifiable privacy**, not convenience
