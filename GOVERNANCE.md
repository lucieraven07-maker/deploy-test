- Funding decisions publicly explained
- Security-related changes thoroughly documented
- Research findings shared with community

## 7. Evolution of Governance

This governance structure may evolve as the project grows. Changes will be:
1. Proposed with 30-day discussion period
2. Require Project Lead + Council majority approval
3. Documented with rationale
4. Communicated to all contributors
